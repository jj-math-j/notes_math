# arithmetic

the process of evaluating mathematical expressions

## anatomy

- **value**: a numeric representation. types of values include:

  - **literal**: a fixed number used in calculations (e.g., `3`, `2.7`, `Ï€`)
 
  - **variable**: a symbol representing an unknown or dynamic value (e.g., `x` in `2x + 3`)

  - **expression**: an operation or combination of operations, along with their operands  (e.g., `2 * 3 + 5`)
 
- **operand**: an input value in an operation (the building blocks of calculation)

- **group**: an expression operand requring calculation before its operation can be performed

- **operator**: a fixed symbol representing an operation within an expression

- **operation**: a deterministic process performed on operands that yields a new value, representing a condensed version of the original expanded operation

## concepts

- **commutativity**: operand order does not affect operation result (e.g., `u + v = v + u`, `u * v = v * u`)

- **precedence**: how the order of operations in an expression is determined

- **associativity**: operation order/grouping does not affect expression result (e.g., `(u + v) + w = u + (v + w)`, `(u * v) * w = u * (v * w)`)

  - **left/right associativity**: how the order of operations with equal precedence are evaluated

- **zero**: the absence of quantity (e.g., `u + 0 = u`, `u * 0 = 0`, `u - u = 0`)

  - **division by zero**: undefined
 
  - **zero exponent**: ???

    - **0 to the 0th power**: ???

- **self**: (e.g., `u + 0 = u`, `u * 1 = u`, `u - u = 0`, `u = u`)

## outstanding questions

- given `a # b $ c`, where operators # and $ have equal precedence, but # is right-associative and $ is left-associative, which operation is performed first? same question, but the expression is reversed `a $ b # c`? are those mathematically valid scenarios?
