# arithmetic

the process of evaluating mathematical expressions

## anatomy

- **value**: a numeric representation. types of values include:

  - **literal**: a fixed number used in calculations (e.g., `3`, `2.7`, `π`)
 
  - **variable**: a symbol representing an unknown or dynamic value (e.g., `x` in `2x + 3`)

  - **expression**: an operation or combination of operations, along with their operands  (e.g., `2 * 3 + 5`)
 
- **operand**: an input value in an operation (the building blocks of calculation)

- **group**: an expression operand requring calculation before its operation can be performed

- **operator**: a fixed symbol representing an operation within an expression

- **operation**: a deterministic process performed on operands that yields a new value, representing a condensed version of the original expanded operation

## concepts

- **commutativity**: operand order does not affect operation result (e.g., `u + v = v + u`, `u * v = v * u`)

- **associativity**: operation order/grouping does not affect expression result (e.g., `(u + v) + w = u + (v + w)`, `(u * v) * w = u * (v * w)`)

- **precedence**: <todo>???

- **self**: <todo>

- **zero**: <todo>

## operations

- **addition**: <todo>

- **multiplication**: <todo>

- **grouping**: <todo>

## shorthands 

- **subtraction**: <todo>

- **division**: <todo>

- **coefficient**: <todo>

- **negative**: <todo>

- **exponent**: <todo>

## outstanding questions

- given `a⊕b+c`, where ⊕ and + have equal precedence, but ⊕ is right-associative and + is left-associative, which operation is performed first? same question, but the expression is reversed `a+b⊕c`? are those mathematically valid scenarios?
