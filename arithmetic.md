# arithmetic

the process of evaluating mathematical expressions

## anatomical glossary

- **Operand**: A number literal, variable, or expression involved in an operation (e.g., in `3 + x`, both 3 and `x` are operands).

- **Operation**: A mathematical process applied to operands, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.

- **Number**: A mathematical object used to count, measure, or label, which can be whole, rational, irrational, etc.

- **Symbol**: A character or notation that represents a mathematical operation or value (e.g., `+` for addition, `-` for subtraction).

- **Expression**: A combination of numbers, operands, and operations that represents a value (e.g., `2 * 3 + 5`).

- **Equation**: A statement that asserts the equality of two expressions (e.g., `x + 2 = 5`).

- **Inequality**: A mathematical statement that describes the relationship between two expressions that are not equal (e.g., `x + 2 > 5`).

- **Term**: A single mathematical component in an expression, which can be a number, variable, or the product of numbers and variables (e.g., in `3x + 5`, both `3x` and `5` are terms).

- **Polynomial**: A mathematical expression that consists of variables raised to whole number powers and coefficients, combined using addition, subtraction, or multiplication (e.g., `2x^2 + 3x + 1`).

- **Factor**: A component of a term that can be a number or variable multiplied together (e.g., in the term `3x`, `3` and `x` are factors).

- **Variable**: A symbol that represents an unknown or changeable quantity (e.g., `x` in the expression `2x + 3`).

- **Coefficient**: A numerical factor that multiplies a variable in a term (e.g., in `4x`, 4 is the coefficient).

- **Constant**: A fixed value that does not change (e.g., 5 in the expression `2x + 5`).

## arithmetic properties

- **Commutativity**: Operand order does not affect operation result (e.g., `u + v = v + u`, `u * v = v * u`).

- **Associativity**: Operation grouping does not affect expression result (e.g., `(u + v) + w = u + (v + w)`, `(u * v) * w = u * (v * w)`).

- **Distributivity**" (e.g., `u * (v + w) = u * v + u * w`)

## side notes

parenthesis are a type of operation (macro???) themselves, as in they have a direct impact the result of an expression
