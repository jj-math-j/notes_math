# arithmetic

the process of evaluating mathematical expressions

## anatomy

- **value**: a numeric representation. types of values include:

  - **literal**: a fixed number used in calculations (e.g., `3`, `2.7`, `Ï€`)
 
  - **variable**: a symbol representing an unknown or dynamic value (e.g., `x` in `2x + 3`)

  - **expression**: an operation or combination of operations, along with their operands  (e.g., `2 * 3 + 5`)

- **operand**: an input value in an operation (the building blocks of calculation)

- **operator**: a fixed symbol representing an operation within an expression

- **operation**: a deterministic process applied to operands that yields a new value, representing a condensed version of the original expanded operation

## properties

- **commutativity**: operand order does not affect operation result (e.g., `u + v = v + u`, `u * v = v * u`).

- **associativity**: operation grouping does not affect expression result (e.g., `(u + v) + w = u + (v + w)`, `(u * v) * w = u * (v * w)`).

- **distributivity**: <todo> (e.g., `u * (v + w) = u * v + u * w`)

## operations

<todo>

## side notes

parenthesis are a type of operation (macro???) themselves, as in they have a direct impact the result of an expression
